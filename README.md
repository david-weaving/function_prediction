## How it works
This app is a function predictor that takes in 6 (x,y) points. These points are passed through an AI model that determines the function type: polynomial, exponential, sine, or natural log. Then, the points are fitted to the predicted function type through mathematical algorithms. If the function is determined to be polynomial, another AI model will further predict the degree (ranging from 1 to 5). Once fitted, the remaining points are generated, and the function itself is returned.
